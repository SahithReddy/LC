/*
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.


Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.


Example 3:
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Follow-up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?

/* ALGOTITHRM: 
Define two pointers slow and fast. Both start at head node, fast is twice as fast as slow. If it reaches the end it means there is no cycle, otherwise eventually it will eventually catch up to slow pointer somewhere in the cycle.

Let the distance from the first node to the the node where cycle begins be A, and let say the slow pointer travels travels A+B. The fast pointer must travel 2A+2B to catch up. The cycle size is N. Full cycle is also how much more fast pointer has traveled than slow pointer at meeting point.

A + B + kN = 2A + 2B
kN = A +B

From our calculation slow pointer traveled exactly full cycle when it meets fast pointer, and since originally it travled A before starting on a cycle, it must travel A to reach the point where cycle begins! We can start another slow pointer at head node, and move both pointers until they meet at the beginning of a cycle.

Can they meet before also? No because slow pointer enters the cycle first time after m steps.
