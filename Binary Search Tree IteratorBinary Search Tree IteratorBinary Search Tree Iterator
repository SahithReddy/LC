/* QUESTION 173
Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.

IN SIMPLE TERMS:
It means the inOrder successor for the current element. Inorder successor of a node 'n' is the next node you would visit after node 'n' when you perform inOrder traversal of the BST. It just means that you return the element one by one in BST when they are sorted in ascent order. So you just return the next smallest element one by one.


Example:
        7
       / \
      3   15
          /\
         9  20
         
BSTIterator iterator = new BSTIterator(root);
iterator.next();    // return 3
iterator.next();    // return 7
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next();    // return 9
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next();    // return 15
iterator.hasNext(); // return true
iterator.next();    // return 20
iterator.hasNext(); // return false
 

NOTE:
next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.
You may assume that next() call will always be valid, that is, there will be at least a next smallest number in the BST when next() is called.

/* ALGORITHM USING STACK:

1. We all know that, once you get to a TreeNode, in order to get the smallest, you need to go all the way down its left branch. So our first step is to point to pointer to the left most TreeNode. 
2. The problem is how to do back trace. Since the TreeNode doesn't have father pointer, we cannot get a TreeNode's father node in O(1) without store it beforehand. 
3. Back to the first step, when we are traversal to the left most TreeNode, we store each TreeNode we met in Stack (They are all father nodes for back trace).
4. for next(), I directly return where the pointer pointing at, which should be the left most TreeNode I previously found.
5. What to do next? After returning the smallest TreeNode, I need to point the pointer to the next smallest TreeNode. 
6. When the current TreeNode has a right branch (It cannot have left branch, remember we traversal to the left most), we need to jump to its right child first and then traversal to its right child's left most TreeNode. 
7. When the current TreeNode doesn't have a right branch, it means there cannot be a node with value smaller than it's father node in Stack, point the pointer at its father node.

Time Complexity:

1. hasNext() is the easier of the lot since all we do in this is to return true if there are any elements left in the stack. Otherwise, we return false. So clearly, this is an O(1) operation every time.

2. Next(): 
The question said "in average" O(1) time, which means amortized over all the next() calls.

Each node gets pushed and popped exactly once in next() when iterating over all N nodes.
That comes out to 2N * O(1) over N calls to next(), making it O(1) on average, or O(1) amortized.

DETAILED EXPLANATION: 
Next() involves two major operations. 
One is where we pop an element from the stack which becomes the next smallest element to return. This is a O(1) operation.
However, we then make a call to our helper function _inorder_left which iterates over a bunch of nodes. This is clearly a linear time operation i.e. O(N) in the worst case.

However, the important thing to note here is that we only make such a call for nodes which have a right child. Otherwise, we simply return. Also, even if we end up calling the helper function, it won't always process N nodes. They will be much lesser. Only if we have a skewed tree would there be N nodes for the root. But that is the only node for which we would call the helper function.

Thus, the amortized (average) time complexity for this function would still be O(1)O(1) 

Space complexity: The space complexity is O(h) which is occupied by our custom stack for simulating the inorder traversal.
