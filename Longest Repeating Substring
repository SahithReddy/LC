/* QUESTION: 
Given a string S, find out the length of the longest repeating substring(s). Return 0 if no repeating substring exists.


Input: "abcd"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no repeating substring.


Input: "abbaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest repeating substrings are "ab" and "ba", each of which occurs twice.


Input: "aabcaabdaab"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest repeating substring is "aab", which occurs 3 times.


Input: "aaaaa"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest repeating substring is "aaaa", which occurs twice.

/* ALGORITHM: Binary Search + Rabin Karp

Split into two subtasks

Here we have "two in one" problem :

1. Perform a search by a substring length in the interval from 1 to N.

2. Check if there is a duplicate substring of a given length L.


BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM:

THEORY:
A naive solution would be to check all possible string length one by one starting from N - 1: if there is a duplicate substring of length N - 1, then of length N - 2, etc. Note that if there is a duplicate substring of length k, that means that there is a duplicate substring of length k - 1. Hence one could use a binary search by string length here, and have the first problem solved in O(logN) time.

PSEUDO CODE:
1. Use binary search by a substring length to check lengths from 1 to N left = 1, right = N. While left != right:

    a. L = left + (right - left) / 2

    b. If search(L) != -1 (i.e. there is a duplicate substring), left = L + 1

    c. Otherwise (no duplicate substring), right = L.

2. Return duplicate string of length left - 1, or an empty string if there is no such a string.

RABIN KARP ALGORITHM:

THEORY:
Subtask two, to check if there is duplicate substring of a given length, is a multiple pattern search. Let's use Rabin-Karp algorithm to solve it in a linear time.

The idea is very simple :

1. Move a sliding window of length L along the string of length N.

2. Check if the string in the sliding window is in the hashset of already seen strings.

      a. If yes, the duplicate substring is right here.

      b. If not, save the string in the sliding window in the hashset.


PSEUDO CODE: 
search(L) :

1. Compute the hash of substring S.substring(0, L) and initiate the hashset of already seen substring with this value.

2. Iterate over the start position of substring : from 1 to Nâˆ’L.

    a. Compute rolling hash based on the previous hash value.

    b. Return start position if the hash is in the hashset, because that means a duplicate string.

    c. Otherwise, add hash in the hashset.

3. Return -1, that means there is no duplicate string of length L.
