// Crazy Solution

class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        int palin = 0;
        int input = x;
        while(x>0){
            palin = palin*10 + (x%10);
            x/=10;
        }
        return palin==input;
    }
}



For those that are confused with the argument whether this algorithm is O(N) or O(lgN):
This algorithm is O(N) where N is the number of digits. At the same time it is O(lnX), where X is the input value.
