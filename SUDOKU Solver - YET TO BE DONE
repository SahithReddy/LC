Try 1 through 9 for each cell. The time complexity should be 9 ^ m (m represents the number of blanks to be filled in), since each blank can have 9 choices. Details see comments inside code.

/*
Time complexity is constant here since the board size is fixed and there is no N-parameter to measure. Though let's discuss the number of operations needed : (9!)^9(9!) 
9
 . Let's consider one row, i.e. not more than 99 cells to fill. There are not more than 99 possibilities for the first number to put, not more than 9 \times 89×8 for the second one, not more than 9 \times 8 \times 79×8×7 for the third one etc. In total that results in not more than 9!9! possibilities for a just one row, that means not more than (9!)^9(9!) 
9
  operations in total. Let's compare:

Space complexity : the board size is fixed, and the space is used to store board, rows, columns and boxes structures, each contains 81 elements.
