The important part in quick select is PARTITION. So let me explain that first.

Partition in quick select picks a pivot (either randomly or first/last element). 
Then it rearranges the list in a way that all elements less than pivot are on left side of pivot and others on right. 
It then returns index of the pivot element.

Now here we are SEARCHING kth smallest element. After partition cases are:

k == pivot. Then you have already found kth smallest. This is because the way partition is working. 
There are exactly k - 1 elements that are smaller than the kth element.

k < pivot. Then kth smallest is on the left side of pivot.

k > pivot. Then kth smallest is on the right side of pivot. 
And to find it you actually have to find k-pivot smallest number on right.
