/* 659. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences

Given an array nums sorted in ascending order, return true if and only if you can split it into 1 or more subsequences such that each subsequence consists of consecutive integers and has length at least 3.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3, 4, 5

Example 3:
Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: False
 

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10000
