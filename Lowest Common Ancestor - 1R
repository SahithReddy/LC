class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        
        if(p.val<root.val && q.val<root.val ){
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        }
        else if(p.val>root.val && q.val>root.val){
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        }
        else return root;
    }
}

Time: O(n) Space: O(n) beacuse of recursion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

if both p and q exist in Tree rooted at root, then return their LCA
if neither p and q exist in Tree rooted at root, then return null
if only one of p or q (NOT both of them), exists in Tree rooted at root, return it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It’s always not easy to explain recursive solutions but I will try..

There is an assumption that p and q nodes exist and are part of the tree.

Let’s start from the beginning, from the root node.
If root of the tree is p or q then line

if(root == p || root == q) return root;

returns real root which is LCA since it’s doesn’t matter where second (p or q) is – root is LCA anyway.

Let’s say root node is not p or q then it checks left branch first

TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);

And then right branch:

TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

If it found p or q on the left it stops and returns that node and doesn’t check the rest of the left sub tree.
Why? Because if second node (p or q) is somewhere below in the current left sub tree – then current node is LCA 
and it already has it. How does it know whether second node is below in the current sub tree or not? It goes to check a 
right branch.
If right branch doesn’t have second node then it’s somewhere below in the left sub tree where we found first p or q 
and it’s below the node we already found so the node we found on the left is LCA.
If second node is on the right branch then LCA is a node for which both lines

TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q); and

TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

return != null left and right

It checks this here:
return left != null && right != null ? root
Hopefully this helps.
