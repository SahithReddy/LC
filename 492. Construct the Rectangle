//The Width is always less than or equal to the square root of area
so we start searching at sqrt(area) and decrease from there till we find the result


class Solution {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        int width = (int)Math.sqrt(area);
        while(area%width!=0) width--;
        return new int[]{area/width,width};
    }
}

// this based on the fact that if we have length = a, width = b, then if a*b = c, then a or b must smaller than sqrt(c)
