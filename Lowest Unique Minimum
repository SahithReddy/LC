I believe this is an O(N) solution in both time and space:

HashSet seenOnce;     // sufficiently large that access is O(1)
HashSet seenMultiple; // sufficiently large that access is O(1)

for each in input // O(N)
    if item in seenMultiple
        next
    if item in seenOnce
        remove item from seenOnce
        add to item seenMultiple
    else
        add to item seeOnce

smallest = Integer.MAX_VALUE
for each in seenOnce // worst case, O(N)
    Smallest = Math.min(smallest, item)
