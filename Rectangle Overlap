    That means even if one condition out of 4 fails then the rectangles overlap.
}
The condition "rec1 is to the left of rec2" is rec1[2] <= rec2[0], that is the right-most x-coordinate of 
rec1 is left of the left-most x-coordinate of rec2. The other cases are similar.

similar we have to check if the rec1 is to the total right of rec2.

Time O(1);
