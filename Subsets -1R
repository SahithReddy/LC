class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> subsets = new ArrayList<>();
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        allSubsets(0, nums, new ArrayList<>(), subsets);
        return subsets;
    }
        
        private void allSubsets(int index, int[] nums, List<Integer> current, List<List<Integer>> subsets){
            subsets.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
            for(int i = index; i<nums.length; i++){
                current.add(nums[i]);
                allSubsets(i+1, nums, current, subsets);
                current.remove(current.size()-1);
            }
        }
    
}

T=O(2^n) as total 2^n possible subsets can be there for n items.
S=O(n+n)=O(n) is the (maximum depth of recursion tree+ 'num' list space)


The recursive function is called 2^n times. Because we have 2 choices at each iteration in nums array. Either we include 
nums[i] in the current set, or we exclude nums[i]. This array nums is of size n = number of elements in nums.


We need to create a copy of the current set because we reuse the original one to build all the valid subsets. This copy 
costs O(n) and it is performed at each call of the recursive function, which is called 2^n times as mentioned in above. 
So total time complexity is O(n x 2^n)


For space complexity:

For recursion: max depth the call stack is going to reach at any time is length of nums, n.

For output: we're creating 2^n subsets where the average set size is n/2 (for each A[i], half of the subsets will 
include A[i], half won't) = n/2 * 2^n = O(n * 2^n). Or in a different way, the total output size is going to be the 
summation of the binomial coefficients, the total number of r-combinations we can make at each r size * r elements 
from 0..n which evaluates to n*2^n. More informally, at size 0, how many empty sets can we make from n elements, 
then at size 1 how many subsets of 1 elements can we make from n elements, at size 2, how many subsets of 2 elements 
can we make ... at size n, etc.

So total is call stack of n + output of n2^n = O(n2^n). If we don't include the output (eg if just asked to print in an 
interview) then just O(n) of course.

// The best and easy BFS solutiomn. But, this solution works only for this subset problem and is not a pattern
While iterating through all numbers, for each new number, we can either pick it or not pick it
1, if pick, just add current number to every existing subset.
2, if not pick, just leave all existing subsets as they are.
We just combine both into our result.

For example, {1,2,3} intially we have an emtpy set as result [ [ ] ]
Considering 1, if not use it, still [ ], if use 1, add it to [ ], so we have [1] now
Combine them, now we have [ [ ], [1] ] as all possible subset

Next considering 2, if not use it, we still have [ [ ], [1] ], if use 2, just add 2 to each previous subset, we have [2], [1,2]
Combine them, now we have [ [ ], [1], [2], [1,2] ]

Next considering 3, if not use it, we still have [ [ ], [1], [2], [1,2] ], if use 3, just add 3 to each previous subset, we have [ [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3] ]
Combine them, now we have [ [ ], [1], [2], [1,2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3] ]

public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        result.add(new ArrayList<>());
        for(int n : nums){
            int size = result.size();
            for(int i=0; i<size; i++){
                List<Integer> subset = new ArrayList<>(result.get(i));
                subset.add(n);
                result.add(subset);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
