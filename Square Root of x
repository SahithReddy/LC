The sequence 1, 2, ... , n has no duplication.

Near the very end, closest step, before while loop, left = mid = right.

In while, If mid*mid < x, left = mid + 1 executed, right pointer is not moving, and right is the answer.

If while, If mid*mid > x, right = mid - 1 executed, right pointer shifts left, closest to sqrt(x), right is also the answer.

Tke example of 16 to understand this.


class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if(x==0) return 0;
        int left =1;
        int right =x;
        while(left<=right){
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            if(mid == x/mid) return mid;
            if(mid<=x/mid){
                left = mid+1;
            } else{
                right = mid-1;
            }
        } return right;
    }
}

Tinme: O(log N)
Space: O(1)
