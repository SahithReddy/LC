/* QUESTION: 567. -- SAME AS Find All Anagrams in a String

Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.


Example 1:

Input: s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: True
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").
Example 2:

Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: False
 

Constraints:
The input strings only contain lower case letters.
The length of both given strings is in range [1, 10,000].

/* ALGORITHM: SLIDING WINDOW -- SAME AS Find All Anagrams in a String

1. How do we know string p is a permutation of string s? Easy, each character in p is in s too. So we can abstract all permutation strings of s to a map (Character -> Count). i.e. abba -> {a:2, b:2}. Since there are only 26 lower case letters in this problem, we can just use an array to represent the map.
2. How do we know string s2 contains a permutation of s1? We just need to create a sliding window with length of s1, move from beginning to the end of s2. When a character moves in from right of the window, we subtract 1 to that character count from the map. When a character moves out from left of the window, we add 1 to that character count. So once we see all zeros in the map, meaning equal numbers of every characters between s1 and the substring in the sliding window, we know the answer is true.

    for (int i = 0; i < len2; i++) {
        count[s2.charAt(i) - 'a']--;
        if(i - len1 >= 0) { // When window exceeds the length of s1 whose permutation/anagram we are searching for
		count[s2.charAt(i - len1) - 'a']++; // shrinking the window and giving back the corresponding characher count to count array
	}
        if (allZero(count)) return true;
