/* 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest

Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest.  You may return the result in any order.

Example 1:
              1
             / \
            2   3
           /\   /\
          4  5 6  7

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
 

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the given tree is at most 1000.
Each node has a distinct value between 1 and 1000.
to_delete.length <= 1000
to_delete contains distinct values between 1 and 1000.

--------------------------
/* ALGORITHM: RECURSION
Check for a node that is root (has no parent) and isn't deleted,
Only then when will we add it to the result.

1. if (is_root && !deleted) res.add(node)
  a. is_root: The node's parent is deleted. The node is the root node of the tree in the forest.
  b. !deleted: The node is not in the to_delete array.
2. We only need to add the root node of every tree.

The question is composed of two requirements:

1. To remove a node, the child need to notify its parent about the child's existance.
2. To determine whether a node is a root node in the final forest, we need to know [1] whether the node is removed (which is trivial), and [2] whether its parent is removed (which requires the parent to notify the child)

It is very obvious that a tree problem is likely to be solved by recursion. The two components above are actually examining interviewees' understanding to the two key points of recursion:

passing info downwards -- by arguments
passing info upwards -- by return value
