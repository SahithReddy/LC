/* QUESTION
I have been doing some binary search problems. I have seen many similar solutions for binary search but with subtle differences:

in some solutions, each loop shrink the search range using : left = mid +1, or right = mid -1;
some other solutions use: left = mid + 1, or right = mid
Can some one help me understand when to use 1) and when to use 2)? Thank you very much!

In addition, about the termination condition, I saw some solution uses left < right, while other solution uses left <= right. Is there a rule of thumb when to use which? Appreciate any tips!
