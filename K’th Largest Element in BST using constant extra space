/* THEORY:
The idea is to use Reverse Morris Traversal which is based on Threaded Binary Trees. Threaded binary trees use the NULL pointers to store the successor and predecessor information which helps us to utilize the wasted memory by those NULL pointers.

To find Kth largest element in a Binary search tree, the simplest logic is to do reverse inorder traversal and while doing reverse inorder traversal simply keep a count of number of Nodes visited. When the count becomes equal to k, we stop the traversal and print the data. It uses the fact that reverse inorder traversal will give us a list sorted in descending order.

*/

/* ALGORITHM:
1) Initialize Current as root.
2) Initialize a count variable to 0.
3) While current is not NULL :
   3.1) If current has no right child
   a) Increment count and check if count is equal to K.
      1) If count is equal to K, simply return current 
         Node as it is the Kth largest Node.
   b) Otherwise, Move to the left child of current.

   3.2) Else, here we have 2 cases:
   a) Find the inorder successor of current Node. 
      Inorder successor is the left most Node 
      in the right subtree or right child itself.
   b) If the left child of the inorder successor is NULL:
      1) Set current as the left child of its inorder 
         successor.
      2) Move current Node to its right.
   c) Else, if the threaded link between the current Node 
      and it's inorder successor already exists :
      1) Set left pointer of the inorder successor as NULL.
      2) Increment count and check if count is equal to K.
           a) If count is equal to K, simply return current
              Node as it is the Kth largest Node.

      3) Otherwise, Move current to it's left child.
