// VERY INTELLIGENT/CLEVER/SHORT SOLUTION
Read this blogpost: https://www.programcreek.com/2015/01/leetcode-find-median-from-data-stream-java/  (has a picture)

class MedianFinder {

    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    PriorityQueue<Integer> min = new PriorityQueue<>(); //MIN HEAP Holds the upper half of the numbers
    PriorityQueue<Integer> max =  new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder()); //MAX HEAP holds the lower half of the numbers
    public MedianFinder() {
        
    }
    
    // we know the large will gain one more item and small will remain the same size, but we cannot just push 
    the item into large. What we should do is we push the new number into small and pop the maximum item from small 
    then push it into large
    Therefore to add a number, we have 3 O(log n) heap operations
    
    public void addNum(int num) {
        min.offer(num); --->(1)
        max.offer(min.poll()); ----> (2)
        if(max.size() > min.size()){
            min.offer(max.poll());  ------>(3)
        }
    }
    
    // Alltogether, the add operation is O(logn), The findMedian operation is O(1).
    public double findMedian() {
        if(max.size() == min.size()){
            return (max.peek() + min.peek())/2.0;
        }
        else return min.peek();
    }
}

// Hint to self: Follow the code line by line and you fill figure it out. It is clever but easy.

At worst, there are three heap insertions and two heap deletions from the top. Each of these takes about O(logn) time.
Finding the mean takes constant O(1)O(1) time since the tops of heaps are directly accessible. So O(logN).

Space complexity: O(n) linear space to hold input in containers.
