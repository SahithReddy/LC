class MovingAverage {
    Queue<Integer> q;
    double sum=0;
    int s;
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        q = new LinkedList();
        s = size;
    }
    
    public double next(int val) {
        if(s == q.size()){
            sum = sum - q.poll();
        }
        
        q.offer(val);
        sum+=val;
        return sum/q.size();
    }
}

Time Complexity: \mathcal{O}(N)O(N) where NN is the size of the moving window, since we need to retrieve NN 
elements from the queue at each invocation of next(val) function.
Space Complexity: \mathcal{O}(M)O(M), where MM is the length of the queue which would grow at each invocation 
of the next(val) function.
