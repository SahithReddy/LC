/* QUESTION: 
Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

Example:

MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
*/

class MovingAverage {
    Queue<Integer> q;
    double sum=0;
    int s;
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        q = new LinkedList();
        s = size;
    }
    
    public double next(int val) {
        if(s == q.size()){
            sum = sum - q.poll();
        }
        
        q.offer(val);
        sum+=val;
        return sum/q.size();
    }
}

/*
Time Complexity: O(1), as we can see that there is no loop in the next(val) function.
Space Complexity: O(M), where M is the length of the queue which would grow at each invocation 
of the next(val) function.
