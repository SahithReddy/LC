// Good explanation of colliosion, resolution techniques like linear probing, quadratic probing, Double Hashing. Load Factor 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdGs0S9iPi4 --> Summary Below

Load Factor = N/Mwhere N= no of keys & M=no of hash address. Load factor is directly proportional to collision probability

Collision Depends on Factors:
1. Distribution of key values
2. Selection of hashing techniques (Division Method, Mid Square method, Folding Method)
3. Load factor

Closed Addressing - When collision occurs we use chaining method(LinkedList would be used to store) to store values in the addresses

Open Addressing = when collision occurs we use probing to store values in the address
