/* 299. Bulls and Cows

You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows. 

Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits.

Example 1:
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"

Output: "1A3B"

Explanation: 1 bull and 3 cows. The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.

Example 2:
Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"

Output: "1A1B"

Explanation: The 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow.

Note: You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.

/* ALGORITHM: INTEGER ARRAY if size 10(Digits 0-9)
The idea is to iterate over the numbers in secret and in guess and count all bulls right away. For cows maintain an array that stores count of the number appearances in secret and in guess. Increment cows when either number from secret was already seen in guess or vice versa.

*/

class Solution {
    public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
    //table records the appearance of a digit
    //digit from secret will increase the counter
    //digit from guess will decrease the counter
    int[] count = new int[10];
    
    int bulls = 0, cows = 0;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < secret.length(); i++){
        int a = secret.charAt(i) - '0', b = guess.charAt(i) - '0';
        if( a == b){
            //accurate match (same digit with same position)
            bulls ++;
        }else{
            
            //if prev part of guess has curr digit in secret
            //then we found a pair that has same digit with different position
            if(count[a] < 0) cows ++;
            
            //if prev part of secret has curr digit in guess
            //then we found a pair that has same digit with different position                
            if(count[b] > 0) cows ++;
            
            count[a] ++;
            count[b] --;
        }
    }
    
    return bulls + "A" + cows + "B";
    }
}


/* COMPLEXITY:

Time is O(n) for the loop.

Space is O(1) as only two arrays of length 10 are used.
