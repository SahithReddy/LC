/* 809. Expressive Words
Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling, such as "hello" -> "heeellooo", "hi" -> "hiiii".  In these strings like "heeellooo", we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same:  "h", "eee", "ll", "ooo".

For some given string S, a query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to S by any number of applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is 3 or more.

For example, starting with "hello", we could do an extension on the group "o" to get "hellooo", but we cannot get "helloo" since the group "oo" has size less than 3.  Also, we could do another extension like "ll" -> "lllll" to get "helllllooo".  If S = "helllllooo", then the query word "hello" would be stretchy because of these two extension operations: query = "hello" -> "hellooo" -> "helllllooo" = S.

Given a list of query words, return the number of words that are stretchy. 

 
Input: 
S = "heeellooo"
words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"]
Output: 1

Explanation: 
We can extend "e" and "o" in the word "hello" to get "heeellooo".
We can't extend "helo" to get "heeellooo" because the group "ll" is not size 3 or more.

/* UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION
As far as I can see, the requirements are as follows:

1. If a letter is not repeated in a word in the words list, the stretched word must contain either one such letter, or three or more such letters, but not two such letters.
2. If a letter is repeated once (two same consecutive letters), the stretched word must contain two or more such letters.
My opinion is based on the following test input data and expected output:

Input:
"dddiiiinnssssssoooo"
["dinnssoo","ddinso","ddiinnso","ddiinnssoo","ddiinso","dinsoo","ddiinsso","dinssoo","dinso"]

Expected:
3

I believe that the following three words in the list are stretchy:
"dinnssoo"
"ddiinnso"
"ddiinnssoo"

The other words must be rejected as each of them contains only one n, whereas the string S contains two consecutive n's.

For example, for word="ddiinnso", its groups of same continuous characters are ["dd", "ii", "nn", "s", "o"], therefore it is "strechy" with respective to S="dddiiiinnssssssoooo" because we just extend "dd"->"ddd", "ii"->"iiii", keep "nn" as it is, "s"->"ssssss" and "o"->"oooo".
