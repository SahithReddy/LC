/* QUESTION: 
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
Follow up:

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
*/


class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int max_so_far = nums[0];
        int max_current = nums[0];
        for(int i=1; i<nums.length; i++){
            max_current = Math.max(nums[i], max_current + nums[i]);
            max_so_far = Math.max(max_so_far, max_current);
        }
        return max_so_far;
    }
}

/*
Time complexity : O(N) since it's one pass along the array.

Space complexity : O(1), since it's a constant space solution.
