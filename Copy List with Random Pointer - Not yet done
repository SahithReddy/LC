Question:
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

/*
Got a better solution without HashMap(Space O(1)) below this.
An intuitive solution is to keep a hash table for each node in the list, via which we just need to iterate the list in 2 rounds respectively to create nodes and assign the values for their random pointers. As a result, the space complexity of this solution is O(N), although with a linear time complexity.

  if (head == null) return null;
  
  Map<RandomListNode, RandomListNode> map = new HashMap<RandomListNode, RandomListNode>();
  
  // loop 1. copy all the nodes
  RandomListNode node = head;
  while (node != null) {
    map.put(node, new RandomListNode(node.label));
    node = node.next;
  }
  
  // loop 2. assign next and random pointers

    map.get(node).next = map.get(node.next);
    map.get(node).random = map.get(node.random);
    node = node.next;

  return map.get(head);

// Time: O(N)
// Space is O(N) because of HashMap. Below is a better solution without HashMap i.e Space:O(1)

/*
For a pictorial understanding of below algo and explain--> Go to 1st comment on the top most solution --> It got a good picture

As an optimised solution, we could reduce the space complexity into constant. The idea is to associate the original node with its copy node in a single linked list. In this way, we don't need extra space to keep track of the new nodes.

The algorithm is composed of the follow three steps which are also 3 iteration rounds.

1. Iterate the original list and duplicate each node. The duplicate
of each node follows its original immediately.
2. Iterate the new list and assign the random pointer for each
duplicated node.
3. Restore the original list and extract the duplicated nodes.

  // First round: make copy of each node,
  // and link them together side-by-side in a single list.
  while (iter != null) {
    next = iter.next;

    RandomListNode copy = new RandomListNode(iter.label);
    iter.next = copy;
    copy.next = next;

    iter = next;
  }

  // Second round: assign random pointers for the copy nodes.
  iter = head;
  while (iter != null) {
    if (iter.random != null) {
      iter.next.random = iter.random.next;
    }
    iter = iter.next.next;
  }

  // Third round: restore the original list, and extract the copy list.
  iter = head;
  RandomListNode pseudoHead = new RandomListNode(0);
  RandomListNode copy, copyIter = pseudoHead;

  while (iter != null) {
    next = iter.next.next;

    // extract the copy
    copy = iter.next;
    copyIter.next = copy;
    copyIter = copy;

    // restore the original list
    iter.next = next;

    iter = next;

// Time: O(N)
// Space: O(1) that is no extra space --> Space is O(N) if output is taken to consideration.
