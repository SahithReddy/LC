/* ALGORITHM:
First understand prime or not
This loop continues until the value of the count is less than n. If the condition is true then it will increase the value of num by 1.
The for loop begins with the initialization of i by 2 till the value is less than or equal to num. Every time when the condition is true it will divide the value of num by i and checks if its equal to zero or not. If it is equal to zero, the loop breaks and checks whether i is equal to num. If it is so then the value of count is increased by 1 and then again checks the condition of while loop.
When the while loop terminates we get our final value in the variable num.

// Code:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Prime {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int num=1, count=0, i;
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter a number to find the nth prime number: ");
    int n = sc.nextInt(); 
    while (count < n){
      num=num+1;
      for (i = 2; i <= num; i++){
        if (num % i == 0) {
          break;
        }
      }
      if ( i == num){
        count = count+1;
      }
    }
    System.out.println("Value of nth prime is: " + num);
  }
}
