Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at the contiguous location, the elements are linked using pointers as shown below.
In Java, LinkedList can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class. The LinkedList class contains a reference of Node class type.

*/
class LinkedList { 
	Node head; // head of list 

	/* Linked list Node*/
	class Node { 
		int data; 
		Node next; 

		// Constructor to create a new node 
		// Next is by default initialized 
		// as null 
		Node(int d) { data = d; } 
	} 
}
